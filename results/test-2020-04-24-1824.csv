4-bedroom-3-bathroom-4315-nw-37a-ave,4315 NW 37a Ave,,,,Edmonton,CA,,2020-04-19T10:19:35Z,"2000 SQFT BUNGALOW WITH OVERSIZED TRIPLE ATTACHED GARAGE, .3 ACRE LOT AND SIDING MILL CREEK RAVINE! This is a truly unique custom and quality built bungalow that is one of a kind. The main floor offers 2 beds, formal and informal living rooms, dining areas (one could easily be turned into a den) and a bright kitchen. The open concept is sure to please, making entertaining friends and family a breeze. The master bedroom is very spacious and features a distinctive layout but has plenty of room to redesign if one wants too. Moving to the heart of this home, you will love the kitchen with built in s.s. appliances, loads of cabinetry and counter space. The basement is fully finished with 2 more beds, rec room, craft room and a wet bar. But lets face it, you're buying this home for its awesome 3 (maybe 4) car garage that has a third overhead door that accesses the backyard, .3 acre massive lot that sides the ravine and the endless possibilities that over 3500 sqft of living space brings!

Here is your chance to own his 3 bedroom bilevel that backs onto walking trails in Kiniski Gardens. Waldo has loved this bright and sunny home with a south facing living room that brings in lots of light all year long. The kitchen and dining area are perfect spaces for Waldo to make meals for his friends. He's upgraded the appliances, and even installed a dishwasher (his kids were happy they didn't have to do it anymore). The two bedrooms and 4 piece bath on the main floor were great when Waldo was raising his family here. Downstairs is just as bright and sunny thanks to the large bilevel windows (Waldo has replaced all the windows too, so you don't have to). There's a large bedroom, a 3 piece bath and a bright family room. The yard is fenced so Woof the dog doesn't get away, but when it's time for a walk Waldo just heads out of the back gate onto the walking trails and park space right behind the home. Waldo has done a great job with this house, and now its your turn! (id:32586)","[{""key"":""Primary Agent"",""value"":[""Christopher D.
