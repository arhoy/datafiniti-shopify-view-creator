Technically, the PL3 is a combination of the waterproof 2.7K camera and the original payload release mechanism. Now, with the PL3, and compared to the previous model (PL2) , you now have the added benefit of a gimbal mounted camera, as well as being able to record your payload release or rescue operation to a MicroSD card, which was not possible. The 2.7K camera is stabilized by 4 rubber damping balls, ensuring the recording of steady footage while carrying and dropping a payload. It is very simple to use, you can tilt the camera from the remote controller to view what's in front of the drone, and also where your items are to be dropped. This is very convenient, especially during rescue or life saving operations , and this is happening in real time with live video back to the FPV screen which is in the palm of your hands. Thanks to the PL3, the Splash drone 3 is now able to offer you a more precise release of fishing traces or bait, or lifesaving equipment over a wide radius from your position, and is fully under your control.
